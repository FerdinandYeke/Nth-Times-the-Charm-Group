      <h2>Persona 1: Jess</h2>
      <h3>Retired woman • Volunteers part time • Only cooks for two people • Not tech-saavy </h3>

      <div class="persona-content">
        <p>Jess Dove is an elderly woman in her late 60's. Jess is retired, where she does not work. Jess also only cooks for two people, where meal size and cooking time is not by much. Jess's profession before retirement was Professional Chef. Graduating from Sam Houston State University in 1970 from its culinary program at age 23. Jess then worked at a local restaurant in Houston then worked at multi-star restaurant in Houston and at New York City for about 40 years. During this time, Jess married in 1978 to Marc Vas at age 31 in Austin, Texas. Marc Vas is an architect who graduated from Rice University with a master's in architecture and design in 1970.</p> 
        <p>During her time as a chef, Jess had little experience with handing stuff digitally based on the restaurants that she had worked at. Though she believes that things digitally handled with restaurants can be beneficial, she prefers doing things more traditionally, like interacting with customers, taking orders, knowing somewhat about the customer and cooking the dish, while also being familiar with the restaurant atmosphere. </p>

    <h2>Persona 2: Rachel</h2>
    <h3>Parent with young kids • Does not work • Deals with depression • Not tech-saavy</h3>

    <div class="persona-content">
        <p>Rachel, age 40, is a stay-at-home mom with two children; Tina age 8 and Dale age 3. She was born in Hampton, New Hampshire, to middle class parents. She grew up having sit down dinners every night and feels guilty that she doesn’t provide that for her children. Her husband, Ben, is a software engineer who commutes to work by train. This typically takes an hour one way. Rachel is the primary grocery shopper and cooks most meals for her household. She must balance managing a household, driving kids to and from school, picking her husband up at the train station, and family social activities. </p>
        <p>Rachel was recently diagnosed with depression, which causes her to struggle with executive dysfunction. She uses social media but is uncomfortable with technology. She would not describe herself as a “computer person”. She frequently gets recipes by googling “easy meals”, “weeknight meals”, and “dinners for picky eaters”. She has some family recipes that have been passed down to her that are frequent favorites in her household. She tries to not spend too much on groceries but would be willing to pay a little extra to decrease her mental load. </p>

He has experience with technology, but has never used an online delivery app before. When he does cook, he uses recipes his coworkers tell him about as well as his own. Isacc takes pride in his cooking and calls his meals “a convergence of flavor”. </p>
