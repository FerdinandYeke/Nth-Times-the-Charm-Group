      <h2>Interview 1: Ryan R.</h2>
      <h3>42-year-old man • Frequently cooks for his family • Works full-time</h3>

      <div class="interview-content">
        <h4>How do you currently plan your meals for the week (if at all)? If you plan your meals, what is your biggest motivator for doing so?</h4>
        <p>My household gets the same ingredients from our local grocery store weekly. This largely dictates our meals. If you develop consistent routines, it makes your life easier.</p>

        <h4>Where do you source most of your recipes?</h4>
        <p>NY Times, Milk Street, make stuff up.</p>

        <h4>How often do you cook at home versus ordering takeout and delivery?</h4>
        <p>Cook at home 3 nights a week. The rest is delivery through DoorDash.</p>

        <h4>What are your top two biggest challenges when trying to cook regularly (e.g., time, decision fatigue, having the right ingredients at home)?</h4>
        <p>Time and effort it takes to do the grocery shopping.</p>

        <h4>When you decide to cook a new recipe, how do you typically get the ingredients? Do you shop in-person, online, or delivery?</h4>
        <p>For a new recipe, I go in-person to Kroger.</p>

        <h4>What frustrates you most about online grocery shopping or delivery apps?</h4>
        <p>Sometimes they get the wrong item or make weird substitutions. It also seems like the shoppers intentionally pick sub-par produce.</p>

        <h4>Would you prefer to pick and customize ingredients (brands, sizes, substitutions) or trust the app to auto-select?</h4>
        <p>I want to pick and customize ingredients. I don’t like an app to make decisions for me.</p>

        <h4>Do you struggle with decision fatigue or executive dysfunction when planning meals? If so, what tools or features help you most?</h4>
        <p>No.</p>

        <h4>When you want to cook, what usually stops you from starting?</h4>
        <p>If there’s something on TV that I want to watch, I’d rather just order food. Go Mariners!</p>

        <h4>How do you currently handle grocery shopping? Do you make lists, go on impulse, or avoid it until necessary?</h4>
        <p>We use the Kroger app and use a lot of past purchases that are stored on my Kroger profile. If it’s a new ingredient, I’ll normally go in-person.</p>

    <h2>Interview 2: Dillon M.</h2>
    <h3>25-year-old man • Does not cook • Works full-time</h3>

    <div class="interview-content">
      <h4>How do you currently plan your meals for the week (if at all)? If you plan your meals, what is your biggest motivator for doing so?</h4>
      <p>I only plan my lunches and honestly, my motivation is to not have to think about lunch. I do the dishes for dinner if someone in my household cooks dinner.</p>

      <h4>Where do you source most of your recipes?</h4>
      <p>N/A</p>

      <h4>How often do you cook at home versus ordering takeout and delivery?</h4>
      <p>N/A</p>

      <h4>What are your top two biggest challenges when trying to cook regularly (e.g., time, decision fatigue, having the right ingredients at home)?</h4>
      <p>Time and general contempt for the process of cooking.</p>

      <h4>When you decide to cook a new recipe, how do you typically get the ingredients? Do you shop in-person, online, or delivery?</h4>
      <p>I have a <strong>STRONG</strong> preference to grocery shop in-person. I actually like the physical process of buying things in a store.</p>

      <h4>What frustrates you most about online grocery shopping or delivery apps?</h4>
      <p>Substitutions are always messed up. They always put random items in there and I don’t understand how they arrive at what they do. It’s really annoying.</p>

      <h4>Would you prefer to pick and customize ingredients (brands, sizes, substitutions) or trust the app to auto-select?</h4>
      <p>I will never trust an app.</p>

      <h4>Do you struggle with decision fatigue or executive dysfunction when planning meals? If so, what tools or features help you most?</h4>
      <p>With bringing lunches to work, I decide the night before. I never decide morning of. I can’t make a decision early in the morning.</p>

      <h4>When you want to cook, what usually stops you from starting?</h4>
      <p>I have never wanted to cook.</p>

      <h4>How do you currently handle grocery shopping? Do you make lists, go on impulse, or avoid it until necessary?</h4>
      <p>I don’t want to know the person who impulses around a grocery store. I always have a list and I have a plan of how to navigate the grocery store. It’s transformed from an act of decision making to something akin to a ritual.</p>

<!-- Interview 3 -->

  <div class="container">
    <h2>Interview 3: Amy K.</h2>
    <h3>62-year-old woman • Splits cooking with her husband • Retired</h3>

    <div class="interview-content">
      <h4>How do you currently plan your meals for the week (if at all)? If you plan your meals, what is your biggest motivator for doing so?</h4>
      <p>I don’t plan for the whole week, more like 2 or 3 days. Healthy and savory is the biggest motivator when I’m planning. And sometimes familiar recipes that have worked before. I also like recipes that have leftovers for extra meals (made chili tonight, no recipe except experience).</p>

      <h4>Where do you source most of your recipes?</h4>
      <p>I have an old binder of favorite printed recipes. I Google recipes and compare. Lately I’ve had some success with creating recipes with AI.</p>

      <h4>How often do you cook at home versus ordering takeout and delivery?</h4>
      <p>Cook at home 5–7 nights, delivery 0–2 nights.</p>

      <h4>What are your top two biggest challenges when trying to cook regularly (e.g., time, decision fatigue, having the right ingredients at home)?</h4>
      <p>Two challenges: sloth and instant-gratification gluttony.</p>

      <h4>When you decide to cook a new recipe, how do you typically get the ingredients? Do you shop in-person, online, or delivery?</h4>
      <p>For new recipe ingredients, I usually pop over to Publix or Fresh Market, occasionally use Amazon for a hard-to-find ingredient. If I were more pressed for time, I would order groceries online for pickup or delivery. There are two retired people in this house—one of whom has already been to the grocery store three times today… for something to do! (You should ask him these questions—he uses more actual recipes.)</p>
      <p>Often what I have on hand in the freezer inspires the recipe search. Simple, best ways to cook a really good piece of meat are valuable and sometimes hard to find. And how long do you steam broccoli? And boil an egg?</p>

      <h4>What frustrates you most about online grocery shopping or delivery apps?</h4>
      <p>Frustration with the apps: selecting a bunch of stuff and then, as you’re going to check out, the app tells you what it doesn’t have in stock and suggests substitutes.</p>

      <h4>Would you prefer to pick and customize ingredients (brands, sizes, substitutions) or trust the app to auto-select?</h4>
      <p>I strongly prefer to pick my own items. Don’t give me plain butter when I want grass-fed butter!</p>

      <h4>Do you struggle with decision fatigue or executive dysfunction when planning meals? If so, what tools or features help you most?</h4>
      <p>The list is the tool! Finally using Notes on my phone, not just paper.</p>

      <h4>When you want to cook, what usually stops you from starting?</h4>
      <p>Emotional exhaustion after visiting my sister with dementia, interruptions, and the fact that late afternoon and early evening are not my most productive times of day. Recipes I can make ahead earlier in the day—or even the day before—are probably more successful.</p>

      <h4>How do you currently handle grocery shopping? Do you make lists, go on impulse, or avoid it until necessary?</h4>
      <p>Lists <em>and</em> impulse. I generally keep stocked up on basics I know we’ll eat that can be combined in different ways (eggs, bread, milk, yogurt, vegetables, fruit, cheese). I subscribe to Moink for pasture-raised, grass-fed meat so I’ve always got some in the freezer and can pull it out in the morning to defrost—plus salmon from Washington!</p>

    <h2>Interview 4: Karen E.</h2>
    <h3>49-year-old woman • Occasionally cooks • Works full-time</h3>

    <div class="interview-content">
      <h4>How do you currently plan your meals for the week (if at all)? If you plan your meals, what is your biggest motivator for doing so?</h4>
      <p>It really depends on the week. The biggest motivator for me is eating healthier, avoiding fast food restaurants, and of course, saving money.</p>

      <h4>Where do you source most of your recipes?</h4>
      <p>Friends and family.</p>

      <h4>How often do you cook at home versus ordering takeout and delivery?</h4>
      <p>Ouch. I don’t like to admit it, but only like 50 percent of the time.</p>

      <h4>What are your top two biggest challenges when trying to cook regularly (e.g., time, decision fatigue, having the right ingredients at home)?</h4>
      <p>Planning the time to meal prep or having time to cook after work and grocery shopping.</p>

      <h4>When you decide to cook a new recipe, how do you typically get the ingredients? Do you shop in-person, online, or delivery?</h4>
      <p>I do in person shopping.</p>

      <h4>What frustrates you most about online grocery shopping or delivery apps?</h4>
      <p>I’ve never tried it, but I would love to. Everyone says that they love it.</p>

      <h4>Would you prefer to pick and customize ingredients (brands, sizes, substitutions) or trust the app to auto-select?</h4>
      <p>I feel like I would trust the app to auto select</p>

      <h4>Do you struggle with decision fatigue or executive dysfunction when planning meals? If so, what tools or features help you most?</h4>
      <p>I struggle with decision fatigue after a long day at work, but planning out meals for the week is beneficial.</p>

      <h4>When you want to cook, what usually stops you from starting?</h4>
      <p>Missing an ingredient for my recipe</p>

      <h4>How do you currently handle grocery shopping? Do you make lists, go on impulse, or avoid it until necessary?</h4>
      <p>I make handwritten lists, but sometimes avoid it until completely necessary.</p>
