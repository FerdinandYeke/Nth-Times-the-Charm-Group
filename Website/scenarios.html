      <h2>Jess Dove's Scenarios</h2>

        <div class="scenario-content">
            <h3>Scenario 1: Using Receipete to beat against time with late night meals.</h3>
            <p>Jess Dove retired at this point in her days but still knows what work fatigue is. In this day, Jess Dove has volunteered at a local restaurant to help fellow workers as well as the community in her neighborhood of getting food. After the long day of work, Jess Dove also wants to make a dish for her family at home for her two grandchildren, and her son. She wants to do the cooking, but she is worried that she won't have enough time to do this for the rest of the day, when by the time she returns home, it is already 5:00 pm. Jess also does not have the time to get groceries, since again she would rather use the rest of her energy to make the best meal for the family than driving front and back from a store.</p>
            <p>To solve this problem, Jess quickly tried to check on her phone's app store to see if there is an app that can solve these things for her by ordering the ingredients at her doorstep. In the app store, she found an app called Recipete. In the app, she found some ingredients that she is familiar with cooking but also at a good price at a store she knows nearby. She places an order and has received it by the doorstep in under 30 minutes. She used the recipes to make some chicken pot pie and her family enjoyed it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scenario-content">
            <h3>Scenario 2: Using Recipete in a restaurant.</h3>
            <p>After experiencing using Recipete, Jess Dove wonders if she can use Recipete for the same restaurant that she had volunteered in recently. One day when going into the restaurant to volunteer in, everything had gone fine, until a customer noted a recipe of orange chicken stir-fry rice with an extra ingredient spice sauce that the restaurant does not really have in stock. Jess Dove, out of pure care, wanted to help. She wanted to use Recipete to get the extra ingredients for the stir-fry. When using Recipete, not only did she find the spicy stir-fry sauce brand that the customer is talking about, but she also found some alternatives to it. With the many impressive options, Jess just decided to stick to the one that the customer is talking about and placed an order on it, while making the stir-fry sauce. When the order arrived at the door, Jess added it onto the stir-fry, then after gave the dish to the customer, where the customer would later highly rate it.</p>

        <br>
        <div class="scenario-content">
            <h3>Scenario 3: Auto-Generated recipes based on groceries.</h3>
            <p>Jess Dove this time was somewhat more familiar with using Recipete. So, one day like before, she decided to make a grocery list of recipes she knew. So, when making the grocery list on her cart that she will order, she got another notification from the app that also states that there is another recipe that uses similar ingredients. Jess got somewhat annoyed by this but was somewhat interested and decided to try out this recipe that the app recommended based on her cart list. When placing an order on the recipe list, Jess also decided to get extra quantities with the ingredients to try out a recommended recipe that she would cook alongside the recipe that she is planning to make. Once she got the ingredients at her doorstep, she started to make her own dish and was finished with it. However, again somewhat annoyed, she decided to also try out a recipe that is new to her but has similar ingredients to the dish she just made. So, she decided to make another dish based on the one that Recipete had recommended to her but also followed the app's instructions on making it. Once she is done, she tried it and it was somewhat nice and would have a “backup” meal plan when the recipe of the dish she wants to make is running low.</p>

      <h2>Rachel's Scenarios</h2>

        <div class="scenario-content">
            <h3>Scenario 1: Low effort weekday dinner.</h3>
            <p>Rachel is a busy stay-at-home mother with two children, ages 8 and 3. Her schedule has been too busy to do a lot of grocery shopping this week but has a reasonably well stocked pantry. She needs to pick a recipe, get any needed ingredients, and cook dinner all within the next two hours.</p>
            <p>Rachel wants to be able to make a recipe that she knows that her picky kids will like. She is low energy today and only wants to pick between a few recipes. She would prefer recipes that she already knows how to make so there isn’t a large cognitive load. Ideally, she would like to be able to search for recipes that mostly use ingredients she already has at her house and take less than 30 minutes to cook. Once she picks a recipe, she wants the app to order and deliver any needed ingredients to her house as soon as possible. She would also like to be sent text updates Recipete indicating what step she’s on and has already completed (e.g., “picking a recipe”, “ingredients selected and ordered”, “shopper shopping”, “delivery driver on the way”) or be able to easily see this information in the app.</p>

        <div class="scenario-content">
            <h3>Scenario 2: Meal plan over the weekend for the coming week.</h3>
            <p>Rachel wants to get a jump on the coming week. She knows that her husband will be working on a challenging project and won’t be able to contribute much around the house. She wants to pick five dinners, some of which can be made in advance and frozen. If she is busy running errands with the kids, she wants to throw ingredients in a crockpot or Instapot so the food can be safely cooking while she is out of the house. She wants to have a sensible grocery shopping list that isn’t super expensive. She knows that she can find some meal prep recipes on her favorite website, “Budget Bytes”.</p>
            <p>To manage her energy level, she wants to be able to plan and select ingredients on Saturday and then have the groceries delivered and do her meal prep on Sunday. She wants to be reminded when she needs to start prepping on Sunday in case she forgets.</p>

            <h3>Scenario 3: Meal plan over the weekend for the coming week.</h3>
            <p>Rachel is hosting Thanksgiving for her extended family this year. Her sister was recently diagnosed with celiac disease and cannot have gluten. Rachel wants to use some of her family’s traditional holiday recipes that were passed on by her grandmother. Her grandmother handwrote all of her recipes on index cards.</p>
            <p>Rachel wants to plan a full menu for ten people. She wants to be able to estimate how much time each step will take so she can make sure not to run out of time on the day. Her brother, who works in a restaurant, has offered to help cook but has asked for a detailed checklist of everything that he oversees.</p>
            <p>Rachel also wants to try some new dessert recipes that were published in this weekend’s NYTimes. Her mother has offered to chip in for expenses, so Rachel wants to be able to keep track of how much she spends on the whole meal.</p>

      <h2>Isaac's Scenarios</h2>

        <div class="scenario-content">
            <h3>Scenario 1: Overtime.</h3>
            <p>One day, Isaac decides to work overtime, meaning he will not have time to go to the grocery store after work. With the Recipeté app, he selects one of his saved recipes and selects the time he would like to have the ingredients delivered during a break. His ingredients are set to be delivered shortly after he returns home.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="scenario-content">
            <h3>Scenario 2: Coworker recipe.</h3>
            <p>Isaac hears from one of his coworkers, Nicole, about a new recipe he is eager to try. She tells Isaac of an app called Recipeté where he can input recipes and the app will order the ingredients to have them delivered to his home. Isaac downloads Recipeté and Nicole hands him a copy of the recipe, which he puts into Recipeté’s recipe creator. Isaac makes note of the ingredients he doesn’t have and schedules them to be delivered after work.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="scenario-content">
            <h3>Scenario 3: Day off.</h3>
            <p>Isaac has a day off, so he decides to randomly select what he cooks for dinner from one of his saved recipes. He does this through Recipeté’s meal randomizer option. Luckily, Isaac already has the ingredients he needs for the meal that was selected, so he chooses the app to display the recipe steps instead. After he finishes eating, he orders the ingredients to be delivered at another time.</p>

      <h2>Tyler's Scenarios</h2>

        <div class="scenario-content">
            <h3>Scenario 1: Recipe building.</h3>
            <p>It’s a Wednesday night for Tyler, who just got done with classes and a long coding lab. He opens his fridge and sees a couple of random things – a half-used jar of sauce, some rice, and a few eggs. Normally this would be the instance where Tyler would order takeout from McDonalds down the road or walk to a Taco Bell down the street.</p>
            <p>He opens the app and picks out the ingredients he currently has. The app shows him some easy to make meals in the fridge with what he already has. One is a recipe for a rice bowl that he can make in 15 minutes with utensils from the kitchen and water.</p>
            <p>Turns out Tyler isn’t all that bad with cooking. The app gives him the instructions to cook and has tons of more options to make an interesting dinner too.  </p>

        <div class="scenario-content">
            <h3>Scenario 2: Grocery restock weekend.</h3>
            <p>It’s a Saturday evening and Tyler has a date with someone coming over and needs to prep dinner for their movie night. He has no ingredients at all for a proper dinner and hasn’t had anytime to grocery shop.</p>
            <p>He sees a recipe for spaghetti and looks up the ingredients for it and sees he only has a jar of sauce, nothing else. Tyler can take the app, look the recipe’s ingredients up and set an order to arrive before the date occurs and cook it.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="scenario-content">
            <h3>Scenario 3: On a tight budget.</h3>
            <p>Tyler is having a struggle with affording any food. He ran out of meal points at his university dining hall and has only 100 bucks left to get him through the month. He can’t afford another takeout meal again and groceries would cost too much to get.</p>
            <p>But not with Recipete, he can input his weekly budget and get recommended meals that fit that requirement. This lets him plan to cook nutritious food while saving as much money as he can.</p>
